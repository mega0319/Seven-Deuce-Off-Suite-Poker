# Seven Deuce Offsuit Poker

created by Naz Khan

This project is using Ruby/Rails for back-end, along with ActionCable for web-socket implementation, ReactJS and JavaScript for the front-end. I also mixed in my own CSS with some Bootstrap CSS features. For animations, I am using the Animate CSS library. Last but certainly not least, I am also tapping into an external API from www.deckofcardsapi.com.

The objective of this project was to create a web-sockets based texas hold'em poker application
where users can connect to the same room and play against each other. Being a poker enthusiast myself,
I enjoy the nuances of the game and getting all of the game behaviors working seamlessly was quite challenging.
